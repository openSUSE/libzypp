##
## This file may contain packages which will trigger the reboot-needed hint.
## So the user gets informed that the system should be rebooted after
## one of these packages was updated.
##
## This config file is for the systems administartor.
## Additional configuration files can be placed in /etc/zypp/needreboot.d
##
## For packages the intended way would be to provide 'installhint(reboot-needed)'
## if the package wants to trigger the needreboot hint. If the hint should be
## shown for packages not providing 'installhint(reboot-needed)', list them here.
##
## Format: Each line must contain either a 'PACKAGENAME' or 'provides:CAPABILITY'
##         to include all packages providing a dependency match for 'CAPABILITY'.
##         Lines starting with '#' and empty lines are ignored.
##
## Example:
##         provides:kernel
##         kernel-firmware
##
