\section intro Introduction

This is a statefull plugin executed at the end of \ref zypp::ZYpp::commit, if the system content has change, i.e. if packages have actually been installed or deleted.

All plugins found in \c /usr/lib/zypp/plugins/system are launched. Unless otherwise specified, messages received need to be confirmed by sending an \c ACC message. Sending back an unexpected or \c ERROR message, the execution of the plugin will be canceled.

If you have e.g. \c zypp-plugin-python installed a basic system plugin could look like this:

\verbatim
#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# zypp system plugin
#
import os
import sys
from zypp_plugin import Plugin

class MyPlugin(Plugin):

  def PACKAGESETCHANGED(self, headers, body):

    // Installation has ended. The set of installed packages has changed.
    // ....

    self.ack()
  def

plugin = MyPlugin()
plugin.main()
\endverbatim
