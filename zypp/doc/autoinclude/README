    */
  or

    */


The .doc files here will mostly provide:

- Other related documentation pages:

  /*! \page page1 A documentation page
    Leading text.
    \section sec An example section
    This page contains the subsections \ref subsection1 and \ref subsection2.
    For more info see page \ref page2.
    \subsection subsection1 The first subsection
    Text.
    \subsection subsection2 The second subsection
    More text.
  */

  /*! \page page2 Another page
    Even more info.
  */

Those pages will per default appear in the documentations 'Related Pages'
section, unless you refer to them from within soome other page by using
'\subpage':

  /** \mainpage A simple manual

  Some general info.

  This manual is divided in the following sections:
  - \subpage intro
  - \subpage advanced "Advanced usage"
  */


- Documentation for a group of classes defined by \ingroup:

  /*! \defgroup g_Resolvable Resolvable Objects
    Some explanation.
  */

- And whatever else we don't want to keep in the header files.
