##
## This file contains requirements/conflicts which fulfill the 
## needs of a running system.
## For example the system would be broken if not glibc or kernel is
## installed. 
## So the user will be informed if these packages will be deleted.
## 
## format: Each line represents one dependency:
## e.g.
## requires:kernel
## requires:glibc

requires:glibc
