You can find here unit tests for lot of zypp classes.

run
ctest .

or the binary itself to run just one test


Note on libboost_unit_test_framework.so.1.38.0
----------------------------------------------

When you run the tests manually, some of the testcases here may fail
with an error message like:

  unknown location(0):            \
  fatal error in "keyring_test":  \
  child has exited; pid: 7222; uid: 216; exit value: 2

This happens because the boost test framework we use monitors the
return code of child processes. This monitoring should be turned off.

You can do this either via a commandfline option:

	 ./KeyRing_test --catch_system_errors=no

Or via an environment variable:

	 BOOST_TEST_CATCH_SYSTEM_ERRORS=no ./KeyRing_test
